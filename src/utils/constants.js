        content: "One question that comes up a lot is \"When using hooks how do I get the previous value of props or state?\". With React class components you have the componentDidUpdate method which receives previous props and state as arguments or you can update an instance variable (this.previous = value) and reference it later to get the previous value. So how can we do this inside a functional component that doesn't have lifecycle methods or an instance to store values on? Hooks to the rescue! We can create a custom hook that uses the useRef hook internally for storing the previous value. See the recipe below with inline comments. You can also find this example in the official React Hooks FAQ.",
